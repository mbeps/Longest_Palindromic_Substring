# Intuition

The problem is asking to find the longest palindromic substring from the given string. A palindromic string is a string that remains the same when its characters are reversed. We need to consider substrings of all possible lengths starting from 1 and find the longest substring that is a palindrome.

# Approach

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming. The approach is to create a table of size NxN, where N is the length of the input string. 

- We start by initializing all the diagonal elements of the table to `True` because a single character is always a palindrome. 
- Then we consider substrings of length 2 to N. For a substring to be a palindrome, the first and last characters should be the same, and the substring removing the first and last characters is also a palindrome. 
- We have already computed whether the smaller substring is a palindrome in previous steps, so we can use that result here. 
- We maintain a variable to keep track of the longest palindrome seen so far. If a longer palindrome is found, we update this variable.

**Steps:**
- Initialize the dp array with `False`.
- For each chain length from 1 to N, fill up the dp table by checking the current substring.
- If the substring is a palindrome, update the dp table and check if it is the longest palindrome seen so far. If so, update the variable containing the longest palindrome.
- Once all possible substrings have been considered, return the longest palindrome.

# Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2). This is because we have a nested loop that iterates over the string, considering every possible substring.

**Space Complexity:** O(n^2). We use an NxN table to store whether each possible substring is a palindrome.
